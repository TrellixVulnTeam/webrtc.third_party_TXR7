Description:
This directory contains i386 and amd64 binaries of the binutils tools
(including gold linker).

They were built from binutils-2.24 using the "build-all.sh" script on a Ubuntu
Precise. 

The script creates chroots for 32bit and 64bit Ubuntu Lucid and then builds
binutils inside the roots.
