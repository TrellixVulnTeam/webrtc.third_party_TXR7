Description:
This is harfbuzz-ng, a new implementation of harfbuzz with a different
API from the old one.

This copy of harfbuzz is usually updated by downloading the release tarball
from http://www.freedesktop.org/software/harfbuzz/release/ , removing
files in src, copying *.h *.hh *.cc from the tarball's src folder
over to src, apply google.patch, then checking for removed or added
files and update our build recipes in BUILD.gn and harfbuzz.gyp
accordingly.

Right now, it uses revision 0d2c2f238bf0a847ecd55a70cc0f081f18a053ac from
https://github.com/behdad/harfbuzz
