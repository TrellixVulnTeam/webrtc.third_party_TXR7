Description:
The Closure Compiler provides warnings for illegal JavaScript and warnings for
potentially dangerous operations, helping you to produce JavaScript that is less
buggy and easier to maintain.

Local modifications:
- The compiler is run via a custom mechanism (see: runner/) that sets the
  compiler to "IDE mode" (single-file checks, doesn't stop on first error).
- Chrome-specific coding conventions to understand cr.addSingletonGetter().
