# ./configure has an embedded CR (ac_cr='^M').  When treated as text, this gets
# converted to a CRLF pair by the codereview site which then makes the patch
# file invalid as such:

# '
# +ac_cs_awk_cr=`$AWK 'BEGIN { print "a\rb" }' </dev/null 2>/dev/null`
#
# All attempts to apply this patch then fail.
