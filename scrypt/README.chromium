Description:
The scrypt key derivation function was originally developed for use in
the Tarsnap online backup system and is designed to be far more secure
against hardware brute-force attacks than alternative functions such
as PBKDF2 or bcrypt.

We estimate that on modern (2009) hardware, if 5 seconds are spent
computing a derived key, the cost of a hardware brute-force attack
against scrypt is roughly 4000 times greater than the cost of a
similar attack against bcrypt (to find the same password), and 20000
times greater than a similar attack against PBKDF2.
